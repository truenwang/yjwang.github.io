This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

About me
======
I am currently a Lecturer in the Department of Information Technology and Electronical Systems Engineering at Daiichi Institute of Technology, Japan, and a doctoral candidate at the Graduate School of Human Sciences, Waseda University. I received my Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Aizu in 2021.

My research focuses on integrating AI techniques with data-driven methods to better understand and support human behavior and emotions. I’m especially interested in transformer models, machine learning optimization, big data analytics, and social network analysis. I’ve also researched the use of blockchain in health-related data systems.

Besides my research, I have participated in international academic conferences for over five years, including presenting papers at IEEE-sponsored events and chairing sessions supported by IET. I also review for several international journals.

You can see updates on my recent research and teaching activities in the Publications and Teaching pages!
