## About Me

I am currently a **Lecturer** in the Department of Information Technology and Electronical Systems Engineering at **Daiichi Institute of Technology**, Japan, and a PhD candidate at the Graduate School of Human Sciences, **Waseda University**. I received my Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Aizu in 2021.

My research focuses on integrating AI techniques with data-driven methods to better understand and support human behavior and emotions. I’m especially interested in transformer models, machine learning optimization, big data analytics, and social network analysis. I’ve also researched the use of **blockchain** in health-related data systems.

Besides my research, I have participated in international academic conferences for over five years, including presenting papers at **IEEE-sponsored events** and chairing sessions supported by **IET**. I also review for several international journals.

You can see updates on my recent research and teaching activities in the **[Publications](https://academicpages.github.io/publications/)** and **[Teaching](https://academicpages.github.io/teaching/)** pages!
